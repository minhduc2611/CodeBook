All states that managed by Redux and ContextAPI must use State-Reducer pattern.

### stores: 
- redux: redux store
- context: context store 
### reducers:
- action-creators: functions that creates actions
- actions: defining actions interfaces (action-type + payload)
- action-types: defining actions-types interfaces
- reducers: state changing factory
### controller:
- hooks: state and functions outlets
- index.ts: exports manager
